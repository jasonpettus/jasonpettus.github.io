<p>Jason Pettus is an artist and arts administrator who has lived in Chicago since 1994. Since 2007 he's been the owner and executive director of the <a href=http://www.cclapcenter.com">Chicago Center for Literature and Photography</a>; but before that, he was a photography major himself at the University of Missouri-Columbia in the '80s and early '90s, then a creative writer for the first 10 years he lived in Chicago. Among other accolades and fun experiences back then, he published three novels, took second in the nation at the 1997 National Poetry Slam, won a grant from the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs/Illinois Arts Council, and performed in such venues as National Public Radio, the Chicago Museum of Contemporary Art, the Frankfurt (Germany) Book Fair, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and more. CCLaP, meanwhile, has published 40 books as of 2015, has won or been a finalist for a dozen awards (including the Lambda Prize for LGBT literature, the Independent Publisher Book Award, and the Peace Corps Experience Award), cracked the Amazon Top 100 in the subject of "Sports Memoirs," was named in <i>Newcity</i>'s 2013 "Best of Chicago" list, and was named one of the best 15 indie presses in the United States by <i>Poets &amp; Writers</i> magazine. He retired from writing in 2004 in order to open CCLaP, but is still continuing to run CCLaP while attending DevBootcamp and starting his new career in computer programming. He is also an enthusiastic dealer of <a href="http://www.ebay.com/usr/cclapcenter">rare books at eBay</a>, specializing in Postmodernist first editions and the forgotten Midwestern masters of Early Modernism; in his spare time he enjoys bicycling, Victoriana, indoor gardening, and nurturing his out-of-control Minecraft addiction. | <a href="contact.html">Contact</a></p>
