            <p>I'm a twenty-year veteran of HTML and CSS, and in 2015 attended DevBootcamp so to gain a working knowledge of JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, Git, TDD-style testing, deploying a live webapp and more. Although I'm fully trained as a back-end junior developer, I've decided to stick at what I'm best at, and am currently seeking opportunities for front-end design, frameworks, animation and testing.</p>

            <p>Under the name <a href="http://www.kirbydotts.com">Kirby Dotts</a> I also run a boutique studio for blog design, videogame development and iPhone apps. I release a new theme every week for Tumblr, Wordpress and Blogspot specs, and am hard at work on my first games and apps.</p>

            <p>Before making the switch to tech development, I spent twenty years in various creative-class positions in the corporate world, including copywriting, print-based graphic design, marketing, content strategy and more. For the last decade I've owned and operated my own small business, the award-winning Chicago Center for Literature and Photography (CCLaP), where I've picked up lots of experience in managing people and projects, fundraising and setting budgets, as well as unique forms of promotion. On top of development positions, I'm also seeking opportunities in project management where I can finally put all of these skills to use together for the first time.</p>
