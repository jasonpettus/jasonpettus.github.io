<article>
<p>(As part of my requirements as a DevBootcamp student, I am maintaining two weekly blogs online, one technical in nature where I re-explain everything I learned that week to a non-tech audience, and a "cultural" blog where I express the emotions I'm going through while taking the classes. For my tech blog covering week 1 topics, <a href="http://jasonpettus.github.io/blog/t1-git-blog.html">click here</a>.)</p>

<p>So just to be clear right off the bat, let me admit the following before anything else, that <i>I utterly and completely failed my entrance interview when first applying to DevBootcamp</i>, or at least I failed every single technical question that was asked of me during my interview. And that's because I completely misunderstood what was being asked of me in the first place; for while I was given a ton of reading to do in the week leading up to my entrance interview, and I did that reading with no problem, when they said in the prep instructions that "I would be asked to do no actual coding," I thought that meant that I should study the underlying theories behind the Ruby commands they were going over, and so that's what I completely and exclusively concentrated on while doing my prep work. But what they actually meant was, "We won't ask you to code an entire program from scratch, but certainly we'll ask you to type an example of, say, a function, and we expect you to be able to sit there and type that function when we ask you to;" but I hadn't bothered to memorize any of the actual keystrokes needed to type Ruby commands (i.e. I didn't know if it was single quotes or double quotes, brackets versus arrows, dashes versus underscores, etc.), and so I failed every single question that was asked of me along this type. And unfortunately, those questions took up 25 out of the 30 minutes of my entrance interview, so I finished the whole thing just utterly convinced that I had blown it all and would not be invited to become an actual student.</p>

<p>Now, obviously I was wrong, and now that I've been working the program for a week, I can see why I was approved anyway -- the entrance exam is much more about judging a person's ability to think rationally, to see how they react when faced with a challenge they can't handle, and see what their ability is to simply be able to say with a straight face, "I'm sorry, I don't know" -- but all that said, the experience really rattled me to my very core, and had me entering DevBootcamp last week with the most amount of trepidation and fear that I've had over anything in my entire life (and that includes running my own business for the last decade, performing in front of thousands of people when I was younger, and traveling in Europe while not knowing anything that anyone around me was saying). And that's because when you're 45 like I am, and haven't been in school in over two decades (and never liked school very much in the first place, even when you were in it), the intimidation that comes with the prospect of doing it again can be insurmountable at times. This is one of the riskiest and most expensive things I've ever done as an adult, and it feels sometimes that there's this huge rock of expectations on my chest and compressing my lungs, this feeling like DBC is my last chance to make a big change in my financial situation and life stability, and that if I screw this one up, it's all downhill from here. It's a hard feeling to get across to someone who hasn't already passed the halfway mark of their life expectancy; but whoo, once you do -- and my fellow middle-agers know what I'm talking about -- it's hard to ignore that increasingly loud ticking clock you're always now hearing in the back of your head.</p>

<p>What rattled me about my entrance interview experience was not that I got the questions wrong -- that was a simple matter of not studying the right things, and now that I <i>am</i> studying the right things while actually in the classes, I'm finding none of it to be too particularly challenging or difficult to learn (but see my tech blog for more on that subject). No, what rattled me was that <i>I was so sure I was ready for that interview</i> going into it, and then learned in a heartbeat that <i>I had made the completely opposite assumption that I was supposed to</i> about what they said to me versus what I took away from what they said. That's a humbling and terrifying experience, to be so sure you knew what was going on, just to find out that you actually thought the exact opposite of what was actually going on; and this is one of the things I'm emotionally trying to come to grips with these days, that it's okay to be middle-aged and still make very stupid, very basic mistakes sometimes, that you're not just going to crumple up into a ball of dust and float away in the wind when that happens. Most everything else with the program is going fine so far, as far as my expectations, my fears, and all the other emotions that come with a big new challenge like this; but that's my main one I'm working on these days, is letting go of the idea that it's a spectacular disaster when someone past the halfway point of their life makes a big giant basic mistake about something.</p>

<p><center>* * *</center></p>

<p>So another thing we had to do in preparation for this assignment was watch a one-hour video by the founder of DevBootcamp, Shereef Bishay, basically a recording of an online talk he did with a group of students about a year ago, in which he addresses a lot of the basic issues that have to do with DBC to begin with, what you can expect, what is expected of you, what kinds of resources will be at your disposal, etc. It was pretty straightforward, but he did directly address one of the things that I've been having a hard time coming to grips with this week, once I learned it for the first time -- namely, that the instructors at DBC are explicitly taught not to hold the hands of students when they start out, which means that if you have problems arise (like a piece of software not working, a problem I had a few days ago), it's up to that student to get online and try to track down the answer through Google themselves, or to hop on the Google Plus discussion board that's been set up for us students, to talk it out among ourselves and try to come up with the answer on our own.</p>

<p>The way Shereef puts it is as the difference beteween a group of you making a meal together in a kitchen, versus the same group going to a restaurant for a pre-prepared meal; in that latter case, you're paying this high price for the experience of being at the restaurant, so you feel entitled to demand things because of that price you paid, for example like angrily sending back your soup if you find a hair in it. But DevBootcamp isn't like a restaurant, it's like a kitchen -- you and your fellow students are in there putting together a meal together, trying things and experimenting, learning tips and tricks off each other based on the individual history you bring to that kitchen, and if you find a hair in your soup in those circumstances, you simply remove the hair and keep on cooking. But when I first heard that (and when I was first confronted with this attitude in practice a few days ago), I admit that I met it with a lot of resistence, because in my mind I couldn't see the difference between the $75 that person paid to be at that restaurant and the 12,000 FREAKING DOLLARS I had just paid to DevBootcamp to be in that program. Or as I put it while screaming at my computer screen at the time, "If I paid $12,000 to be in that restaurant, you're goddamned RIGHT I'm going to angrily complain about a hair in my soup. <b>You're goddamned right I'm going to complain about that.</b>"</p>

<p>What I've come to understand, though, is that what that $12,000 pays for is the environment that's been set up around you to let you be the self-empowered student they want you to be. That $12,000 pays for their downtown classroom space, for the lights and electricity, for the computers they provide on campus. That $12,000 pays for the expertise that went into setting up the cirriculum, for the man-hours that went into building the syllabus and the individual lessons. That $12,000 pays for the people who guide you towards success, for the people who conduct the interviews, for the IT specialist who maintains their databases and processes your application. What that $12,000 does NOT pay for, though, is your right to say to these people, "I don't know the answer, <i>so tell it to me now</i>." And that's because that's not true learning, not in the way that's going to stick with you and really allow you to absorb and internalize the answer; and that's also doing you no favors when it comes time for you to graduate and be out in the real world, where you are forced to go look up things for yourself that you don't understand, because you no longer have a paid teacher around to spoon-feed those answers to you.</p>

<p>That's why the DevBootcamp program is so intensely designed to rely on students helping each other find out the answers to the questions they have, because these are essentially your future co-workers and this is exactly how you will solve problems out in the corporate world too; and I have to admit, a couple of days ago when I was actually able to solve a problem on the behalf of one of my fellow students for them, it was this incredibly empowering moment, not just a chance to help someone else out but a concrete piece of proof that I'm actually learning this stuff myself, that it's actually starting to sink in. It's hard, it's incredibly hard, to hand a person a $12,000 check and have them say, "Great, thanks for the $12,000. Now, lesson number one -- WE'RE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE YOU ANY ANSWERS." But it's important to keep Shereef's "restaurant versus kitchen" metaphor in mind in those situations, and understand that your $12,000 is paying for the kitchen itself, the cooking utensils, and the gas making the oven work, not for your right to scream at the waiter when you find a hair in your soup.</p>

<p>Onward and upward! See you next week!</p>
