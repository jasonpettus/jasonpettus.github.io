  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 5</h1>
  <h2>Regarding the insane amount of problems standing between me and collaborative programming</h2>
  <h3>March 7, 2015</h3>
</header>

<article>
<p>(Today's blog entry will be smaller than usual, because I'm having an extra-hard time with this week's challenges, and want to get back to them right away and not spend too much time this week on this unstructured writing.)</p>

<p>So where do we begin to discuss all the problems in my particular life when it comes to one of the most important aspects of DevBootcamp, the idea of "pairing" (or working with other people) when it comes to programming? This is one of the fundamental bedrocks behind the enire DBC program in fact -- that instead of traditional textbooks and traditional teachers, students are mainly supposed to learn the material by teaming up with other students and working together -- but in my case, this is hampered by a series of problems...</p>

<p>--To begin with, I'm 75 percent deaf; and while this won't be as big an issue once I'm down at the actual DBC classroom space for the second half of the program, dealing with people face-to-face while wearing my hearing aid and able to watch their lips move, I'm struggling <i>badly</i> with the current way we have to do it while doing our at-home period of the program, where we basically team up through video conferencing. In that case, I can't wear my hearing aid and my headphones at the same time, people are often sitting several feet away from their microphones (a.k.a. "speakerphone syndrome," the hated enemy of those with hearing problems), and the imperfect video conferencing software often gets the video and audio off-sync from each other, meaning that I can't watch people's lips to help me understand what they're saying.</p>

<p>--Then on top of that, I can't afford a private broadband connection for my apartment (one of the many reasons I enrolled in DevBootcamp to begin with, so I can eventually get a job that will allow me to afford such things); so that means I have to rely on this free WiFi connection that my building provides as a perk to its renters, with of course in the US the term "free WiFi" being exactly and totally synonymous with the term "shitty WiFi." And so that causes massive problems with simply my connection to others while doing these pairing sessions, with my signal often going down four or five or six or seven times over the course of an hour.</p>

<p>--And then finally is just my natural personality getting in the way, as well as the recent circumstances of my life -- I live alone, I don't date, I've worked from home as my own boss at a single-employee company for the last ten years of my life, and I have a hard time staying patient doing group work with strangers to begin with. So this makes it difficult simply for me to get into the swing of things of having someone else around to begin with, which is then exacerbated by the technical problems, which is then multiplied by my hearing problems.</p>

<p>So yeah, it's safe to say that out of everything I have to deal with regarding DevBootcamp right now, pairing is the one thing I dread the most, that I hate the most, and that I look the least forward to on any given week; but this is a huge problem, because our challenges are designed so that it's nearly impossible to do them by yourself, meaning that you <i>must</i> pair up or else flunk out of the program. And this causes me just an <i>unbelievable</i> amount of stress, anxiety and panic, and makes me really question whether I'm even going to survive this program long enough to get to the last day and graduate. So for now I do what I can -- for one good example, on any pairing session that I can get away with doing this, I meet up with my pairing partner actually out physically in the real world, where I'm able to wear my hearing aid, watch their lips move, and generally have a much better experience -- but in general I'm just gritting my teeth and grimly trying to survive it all, with the understanding that all of this will get much better in another four weeks when the at-home part of the program is finally over.</p>

<p>I'm feeling really defeated this week, like that none of this stuff is ever going to come together in a satisfying way that makes me feel like I'm on top of it all. (And it didn't help that it was my birthday this week too, and that I unwisely decided to take a day off to celebrate it, which did nothing but get me insanely behind on everything, as I was forced to take a second day off to nurse my birthday hangover. Big mistake -- I should've just lit a candle, blown it out, and gone straight back to work instead.) But I also am cognizent enough to understand that a lot of this is because of working at home while physically handicapped and struggling with my WiFi connection, and that this is all bound to get a lot better once I finally get to the classroom center beginning with week 10. If I can just manage to not flunk out and get asked to leave the program by then, I should start doing a lot better, so cross your fingers and wish me luck.
