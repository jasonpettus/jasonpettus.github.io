  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 8</h1>
  <h2>Regarding conflicts in work environments, and middle-age's rise in empathy as an antidote</h2>

<article>
<p>This week in our culture blogs, DevBootcamp wants us to talk about the subject of conflict -- what we think of it, how we manifest it in our own lives, how we've successfully and unsuccessfully dealt with it in the past. And this is a great subject for me to handle, because I'm just very naturally a conflict-oriented guy, seemingly no matter what I try to do to not be so much of one -- I'm single, I'm my own boss, at a company I run by myself from my apartment, I'm an intellectual and former artist, I have an inexhaustibly long list of complaints to always make about others, and I have strong opinions I never hesitate to share. And that's a problem, because I'm never going to survive and thrive in a group collaborative corporate environment with that attitude, will never get noticed and gain fans and receive promotions; so this is part of my onus at DevBootcamp these days, not just to learn the technicalities of programming but to get better at my "emotional intelligence" part of the skills I can bring to an office job, since it's been literally 15 years since I've last had an office job, and I was never that particularly good at them when younger in the first place.</p>

<p>And it's true, I've even had some really frustrating moments with DBC over the last eight weeks too, and it's been tempting to get angry at them for it too; and while I'll show in a bit why it's not really fair to get angry at DBC for these things, certainly I think it's important that those thinking about going through the program at least know about these things, so to be better prepared for them than I was, and to get your brain in the right mindset. For example, just the tech details of staying in communication itself during this at-home part of the program is wonky and full of bugs; DBC tries to do it all through video conference calls via Google Hangouts, but between my hearing problems, my crappy WiFi connection, and other people's lack of decent microphones, it makes all our guided pairing sessions twice as stressful to me as if we were doing them face-to-face, or via text chat, etc. Also, although of course the point is to get through as much material as possible in as short a time as possible, you'll question at times whether the program is simply too fast for people's good, and whether it's worth taking on all the extra stress and anxiety of being constantly half in the dark about concepts because you ran out of time to keep working on them. And finally, although DBC teaches about half its curriculum in the normal, Gregorc-defined "Concrete Sequential" way (i.e. you read a textbook, with information that was deliberately put in a logical, A to B order, you learn all the fundamental theory driving everything as well, then you take a test that judges your retention), they do the other half in the exact opposite "Abstract Random" manner -- they say, "Here's a thing we want you to program, and we're not going to tell you how to do it, and none of your textbook material yet has ever shown you how to do it, and we're not even going to tell you the name of the subject you need to look up to learn how to do it. Just start typing in random search phrases at Google you think might work, look at random websites, and hope that you accidentally stumble across the answer and are also able to recognize it as such." Now, they do this for a specific legitimate reason, and I'll get more into this in a bit too; but I have to say, it's an incredibly stressful and defeating thing to go through for me as a Concrete Sequential learner, and kept me really in this state of confusion and panic all throughout the weeks we were working on Ruby and JavaScript.</p>

<p>It's interesting, though, going through all this at the age of 46 like I am, unlike the early twenties of so many of my classmates; for while it has its distinct disadvantages, like not nearly being able to memorize things anymore at the rate I used to be able to, there are also some benefits of going through something really intense and stressful with the changed brain of a middle-aged man. And a big one of those is not really rising to anger anymore over this stuff, not trying to shift the blame to something I can direct my rage at to mask my own insecurities, even though the insecurities are undoubtedly there and always rearing their ugly heads. And a big part of that is because my capacity for empathy is now higher as a middle-aged person -- it's a lot easier for me to see what the other person is thinking when they make decisions that they do, and be able to see what the whole situation looks like from their perspective. And so in the case of DevBootcamp, I can quite clearly say to myself, "I know you're tempted to get all blown up over these things that are causing you stress, and blame the institution for not running a good program; but if this institution is doing as well as they are, there must be a method to their madness, and just because you haven't seen it yet doesn't mean you won't eventually." And that lets me stay more patient, and be able to realize, things may be at a low point for me right now with learning and absorbing this stuff, but the day will probably be coming soon when you're on the whole other side of that, because there wouldn't be nearly so many great things being said about DevBootcamp if it stayed this frustrating throughout the entire program.</p>

<p>That's another benefit of going through this in middle-age; I've had so many big successes and giant public failures by now, and I've lived through the process of going through the ends of them and knowing that life goes on, that the opposite is just around the corner. So that lets me stay patient about the frustrating moments right now too, simply being older and having more of a certainty that things always eventually come back around in your favor if you wait long enough and work hard enough. And of course there's the fact of this stuff already starting to prove itself; like, the whole reason they teach this Abstract Random stuff in the first place is because this is often how you'll have to work as an actual paid professional programmer at some office somewhere; you'll often have to do things you don't know how to do, and you'll often have to learn it simply by typing in random questions to Google until you accidentally stumble across the answer. It still scares the crap out of me, don't get me wrong; but being scared is a neutral emotion, a natural emotion, something that's not bad or disruptive unto itself, just a knee-jerk reaction we all have to scary things. It's how you behave during that fear, what rational decisions you make, that determine whether you're being "good" or "bad," and it's this stuff that we can have a better understanding of and learn to control better.</p>

<p>I like to think that all this will benefit me in my coming career in the 9-to-5 world of office jobs again; it's such a different situation than the last time I was working corporate jobs, in an entirely different industry in an entirely different decade of living, already having lots of successes now in the arts but no longer trying to make a living at it, which was the exact opposite situation when I was in my twenties and doing administrative-assistant jobs at these offices. It's really the best piece of advice I can give for those who are struggling with this issue, and one of the greatest things about hitting middle-age, that empathy is the antidote for welled-up anger; to understand why a person is behaving the way they do, even if they're annoying or frustrating you, is to defuse the anger you're feeling at them for doing it, and more importantly to learn better how to get them to stop (or at least how to get yourself to stop feeling frustrated by it).</p>

<p>Next week, an entire entry on just one of the things we were talking about today -- how best to verbalize a question in programming you're struggling with, and translate it into a search term at Google that will get you useful results fast. See you again then!</p>
