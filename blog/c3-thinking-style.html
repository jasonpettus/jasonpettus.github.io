<p>So before anything else, two things to explain for today's blog post to make sense...</p>

<p>--One of the first things we were required to do as part of our pre-class prep work for DevBootcamp was to determine what is called our <a href="http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/learning/gregorc.htm">Gregorc learning style</a>, named after the guy who invented the concept, Anthony Gregorc first in the 1970s but who is still refining the subject to this day. It basically boils all human learning down into four main types, and once I took the test myself, I found that my own personal style I prefer boils down half and half to two of them: I'm both a "concrete sequential" learner, which means I vastly prefer to learn things in this nicely rational, structured, sequential way from start to finish, much like how a textbook teaches things; and I'm also an "abstract sequential" learner, meaning that once I learn the theory behind a subject, I like to learn how to put it into practice by experimentation, by trying something and testing it and seeing what happens, then trying something else and testing <i>it</i> and seeing what happens with <i>it</i>, backed up by a lot of solitary inner-mind thought about the subject at hand and the philosophy behind whatever it is that I'm studying.</p>

<p>--And then one of the other things that DevBootcamp really stressed with us during our pre-class prep was the idea of <a href="http://www.brainpickings.org/index.php/2014/01/29/carol-dweck-mindset/">fixed mindset versus growth mindset</a>; or in other words, the difference between seeing learning as something finite, something you learn and then you finish learning, so that you then "know" that thing and can be done with your learning, versus seeing learning as a continual process and journey that lasts your entire life, and that every new thing you eventually come to "know" simply opens up doorways to another dozen things that are still mysteries.</p>

<p>I'll admit, when we were first learning about these subjects in theory at the beginning of the course, it all came across as a lot of new age hokum (and being in the arts for the last twenty years like I have, I already have a dangerously low tolerance for new age hokum), but now that we're actually into the active coding part of classes, I now see with crystal-clear clarity why these kinds of subjects were so heavily stressed at the beginning of it all; because the simple fact is, no matter how smart you are, you are simply not going to get everything in DevBootcamp 100 percent right, 100 percent of the time, and how you handle that wall you suddenly find yourself beating your head against (and especially how you get over that wall to eventual success) is the main difference between graduating from an intensely difficult thing like DevBootcamp and dropping out of it before you're done.</p>

<p>Take me, for a great example -- when all is said and done, last week I ended up being able to quite easily understand about 90 percent of what DevBootcamp was throwing at us, which to be clear was an entire month's worth of work in a typical college class (we learned about Ruby objects, variables, methods, enumerables, operators, arrays and hashes all in five days, and did it by being forced to write about a dozen standalone Ruby programs from scratch, often with the assignments deliberately requiring more information than we had been taught in our textbooks, forcing us to wander around online until we had found the right answers on our own*); but about 10 percent of that material was stuff I simply couldn't understand out of the box on my own, no matter how hard I tried, and I kept failing those particular exercises over and over and over no matter how many times I tackled them, until eventually I simply had to throw my hands in the air, scream to the gods "I give up!," and go "cheat" by looking up the ways my fellow students had successfully tackled those subjects themselves, learning in those cases by after-the-fact example.</p>

<p>(*And for those who have come across this blog through a Google search seeking advice and opinions about whether they should attend DevBootcamp themselves, be aware that this is one of the most frustrating parts of the entire program, yet the thing that I suspect will be one of the most rewarding aspects of all -- that the DBC staff deliberately designs the curriculum so that your "homework" can only be half-solved by the material you've already learned, but that the other half is brand-new stuff that hadn't been covered in the class in any way before that moment, and that it's up to you to go <i>find</i> that information on your own, through Google searches, pouring through the official Ruby documentation, scanning the unread chapters of your textbooks, and teaming up with your fellow students to tackle the problems together. And DevBootcamp does this because this is the way that actual professional coding actually works in the real world -- the way you make the big bucks is by being in a position where you will literally be called on as part of your job to accomplish things you have never done before, and even in your 9-to-5 job you will constantly be required to go look up crap you've never heard of before. In fact, I've talked now about this subject with several of my friends who are already working developers, and every one of them was overjoyed to hear that DevBootcamp is forcing us to work this way from day one; or as my cousin Ian put it, "There is nothing worse in the world than to have to hold the hand of a junior developer and answer all their questions for them." But that said, be aware that it's this aspect of DevBootcamp that most makes you want to beat your head against a brick wall, when you've already put three hours of work into a problem and are still sitting there looking at a page of gobblety-gook that you can't understand to save your life.)</p>

<p>Now, I'm like any typical human, and I'm not ashamed to admit it -- every time this week that I was confronted with one of these ten-percent moments, it threw me into this spiral of panic and desperation and depression and self-doubt, because I'm 45 years old and have already been questioning my ability to be able to learn such a huge amount of new information in such a short period of time, and these ten-percent moments always feel like concrete affirmation of that, proof that I was a fool for ever thinking I could do this in the first place. Ah, but that's a fixed mindset at work, this feeling that you either "know" something or that you "don't know" it, that the only two choices in life are to either get an A on something or an F, and that you are a person who either fundamentally "gets" the subject at hand or that you fundamentally "don't get it." After all, this is the way that our typical educational experience in the US works, classes of fixed time periods where you have a fixed set of material to learn in a fixed set of time, and being declared either a genius or a failure based on how well you do on learning that fixed amount of information in that fixed amount of time; and most of us spend the first 20 to 25 years of our lives living in this kind of environment for eight hours a day, in fact our entire formative childhoods, so it's no wonder that it's so easy for us to get into this fixed mindset, and to feel overwhelmed with panic and depression whenever things don't go 100-percent right for us in a classroom-type environment. (And this is to say nothing about humans' tendency to remember the bad situations in life a lot more profoundly and concretely than the good things. This is the exact reason, for example, that we <i>always</i> remember all the times we had to stand at a bus stop for a half-hour waiting for our bus, but immediately forget all the times the bus coincidentally showed up to the stop at the exact moment we walked up to it ourselves.)</p>

<p>But whenever I've called upon the growth mindset this week when feeling frustrated, it's always helped me keep my panic under control and see the situation for what it is -- that life itself is a constantly evolving journey, and therefore the process of learning about life is a constantly evolving journey too, and that some things in life we're going to immediately understand naturally the first time we come across it, while other things we struggle with for a long time before we finally wrap our minds around them. So in this sense, it's not "cheating" to officially give up on an exercise and go look at how someone else did it, but rather a crucial part of learning that difficult subject; because in reality, if I hadn't already been trying it on my own, that looked-up solution wouldn't make sense anyway, and once I <i>do</i> look up that solution, it suddenly makes sense in a way that sticks with me and allows me to move forward confidently. And I don't feel bad about occasionally doing this, because I can step back and see that 90 percent of this stuff is coming to me naturally without having to do such lookups, and that fundamentally I <i>am</i> "getting it." And when I do hit these walls (which to be clear, literally happens every day or two right now), I can call upon my Gregorc results and be able to do the things I know will help me the best -- look up more textbook-style information, do a lot of hands-on trial-and-error experiments in my coding environment, and really examine those "cheated" answers I looked up line by line, changing the parameters one bit at a time then running the program to see what I get, then changing some other parameters to see what they do, then others, then others.</p>

<p>This is why DevBootcamp gives no formal tests during your time with them, why they don't give out grades, why you have no formal "teacher" in a formal "class" environment; because unlike the typical US high-school or college class, the goal of DevBootcamp is not to walk away with an arbitrary piece of paper that someone has made an arbitrary mark on, but rather to <b>learn how to do the work and get a job afterwards</b>, and they understand the ultimate lesson of a growth mindset when it comes to this subject, that different people learn how to do the work in different ways, in different styles, under different timeframes and while needing extra help in different areas. I mean, obviously there needs to be <i>some</i> kind of structure to it, so that you can actually graduate people and get them out into the working world; but they understand that for each and every one of their students, there will be some things they can immediately understand and move on from, and some things that they will be grappling with over and over, long after that formal "lesson" about the subject is done, and they assume that their students are adults and will put in the extra work on those particular things until they <i>do</i> understand it. That's ultimately one of the biggest problems with US high schools and colleges, that they often serve just as much as babysitters as they do educators, so <i>must</i> adopt a fixed mindset just to keep some kind of control over their students, and to ensure those who rely on those diplomas that that student really did learn the things they needed to learn in order to get that diploma. DevBootcamp, however, treats their students as the autonomous grown-ups they are, and understands that those students will never actually get a good job unless they ultimately learn everything that needs to be learned, that those students are enough of grown-ups to know that they need to sink or swim on their own. That's what a growth mindset is all about, and why it's simultaneously one of the most frustrating yet one of the most fascinating things I've ever encountered in a formal educational environment.</p>

<p>Okay, that's it for this week, so I hope you'll get a chance to come back next weekend for all the latest. See you then!</p>
