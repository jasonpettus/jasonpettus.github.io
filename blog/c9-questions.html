  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 9</h1>
  <h2>How to ask Google good questions, and what this has to do with SEO</h2>
  <h3>April 3, 2015</h3>
</header>

<article>
<p>For our final required entry in our DevBootcamp "culture" blog, we've been told to write about the subject of asking good questions when it comes to programming, in this case to especially concentrate on the ways that humans ask other humans questions so that they get the fastest and best answers. But this really just boils down to some pretty self-evident things that can be summed up in a single paragraph -- be very specific, use sample code to illustrate your problem, be very clear about what the issue is, proofread for spelling and missplaced code, make it A.S.K. (actionable, specific and kind) -- so instead, I thought it'd be interesting to go more into the related subject of how to ask good questions specifically to Google, and how the solutions to this challenge are essentially the same solutions you can apply to a website to help in its so-called "search engine optimization," a big hot topic these days in the world of marketing and advertising.</p>

<p>And that's because, in both cases, the answer is that you need to train yourself to think more like a search engine -- or perhaps you might more poetically call it "thinking like a computer," or might more realistically call it "thinking like Google's algorithms." And how is a search engine's algorithims going to look at a human's plain-language question to determine how best to return a result? Well, it's going to start by trying to figure out the main subject of that search request, by doing things like looking at the first word of the request, seeing if that word is also capitalized, see if it's set off from the rest of the request by a colon or a dash, see whether the request contains language patterns like "what is the [SOMETHING] of [SOMETHING]?" or "How do I [SOMETHING] a [SOMETHING]?"</p>

<p>So that's what you need to do too, is phrase your question in the way that most logically and unambiguously will bring back the answer you're looking for, by writing it exactly in the way that Google's algorithims are looking at it. It's not a hard thing, but a thing you need to be specifically thinking about, that for example if you're looking for advice on how to turn a unidimensional array into a multidimensional hash within Ruby, the thing you should type is "Ruby: how to convert array to hash" or something along these lines. And in fact, this is not just used for asking good questions; if you run a website and apply these kinds of lessons to your content, specifically for reversing this process and convincing Google to list you as one of its first ten results on a specific type of web search, even if that person's question was worded badly, that's known as optimizing your website for search engines, or "search engine optimization," the dreaded "SEO" that is both the bane and the magical key of so many overly excited marketers and sales professionals. SEO can get confusing because these marketing people want to <i>make</i> it confusing, which is how you get a whole cottage industry of SEO software and SEO catchphrases and SEO books and SEO rules; but at its heart it's simply the question of how to get your website to show up at the top of Google searches on specific phrases, and the way you do that is simply by thinking of the way Google's algorithims think, and providing the kinds of things that will convince the algorithims that you should be ranked high in the first place. Lots of people claim that they can "game" the system, which is where the ethically oogy part about SEO that everyone hates comes in; but the simple and ethically clean answer is to do things like organize your content better, phrase it in ways that people are specifically looking for, and convince more and more strangers to list you as an expert on the subject you specialize in, by repeating linking to you, calling you an expert in their own blog posts, interviewing you about the subject, etc.</p>

<p>Next week, a big change, as I detail in <a href="t9-lookback.html">this week's tech blog entry</a>; the at-home Phase 0 of our program is now finished, and this Monday I start attending the second nine weeks of DBC down at their classroom center in downtown Chicago. At that point, this culture blog and that technical blog get merged into one general blog, where I will be talking at length each week about the new technical information I learned <i>and</i> how I was emotionally feeling during that week of classes. I'm told that we'll be covering a lot of issues having to do with Ruby hashes next week -- plus I still haven't gotten to detail the beginning of our studies this week into SQL and relational databases -- so both of those will be coming in next weekend's entry. I hope you'll have a chance to stop by again then.</p>
