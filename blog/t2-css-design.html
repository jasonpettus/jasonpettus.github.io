<article>
<p>In week two of DevBootcamp, we covered the <i>entirety</i> of HTML5 and CSS3, two subjects that often take an entire semester to cover in a typical college class. That's something to really intimately understand about these bootcamp programs, is that they go at an intensely fast rate, and that you need to be ready for a tremendous amount of work when you join one. Instead of a general overview like last week, this week DBC wants us to address a series of more specific topics within HTML and CSS; but nonetheless, for you non-techies out there, I wanted to at least start with a general overview so that you know what exactly we're talking about here today.</p>

<p><b>HTML and CSS: A Ridiculously Brief Introduction</b><p>

<p>HTML stands for "Hypertext Markup Language," and is the backbone behind how every single page on the web looks and feels. Essentially you can think of the internet as a big giant tech platform for exchanging information, but with there being several different ways that that information is shared; for example, there's email, one of the very first things the internet did when first invented after World War Two, in which very plain text-based information is shared between a series of applications that can display this text as a traditional letter. In the late '80s, frustrated by the existing models for scholars to exchange research and papers with each other (remember that the internet first started out as a private government project linking together universities and research laboratories, before it became accessible to the public at large from their private homes), Tim-Berners Lee and others invented this easy-to-use markup language HTML, based metaphorically off an old early-'80s Macintosh program called "Hypercard" which let users hop between index cards of information by including direct links you could click on with your mouse. At the same time, they also invented an application called a "browser" that could read these HTML index cards (now called "pages"), and invented a new way for transmitting this information over the internet (Hypertext Transfer Protocol, or HTTP) which they nicknamed the "World Wide Web." The first-ever website was created in 1991 by the laboratory in France that owns the world's largest particle accelerator, CERN, as a way of sharing their results with other laboratories, and quickly caught on with first thousands and then millions of others.</p>

<p>By the mid-'90s, access to the internet started becoming possible fairly easily and cheaply to the general public for the first time, with these "websites" of the HTML protocol easily becoming the most popular part; and by the late-'90s, commercial corporate companies were building their own websites as a way of attracting customers. It was at this point that the graphic designers of traditional ad agencies were confronted with the non-existent controls for actually fine-tuning the look and feel of websites, which let's remember was originally invented only to share academic research papers; and so an ad-hoc group of volunteers from around the world (known as the nonprofit World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C) invented a new protocol called Cascading Style Sheets or CSS, that could be "added" to HTML to give designers much more control over how a web page looks and behaves, as long as that end user has upgraded to a newer version of their browser that can understand CSS commands. CSS doesn't replace HTML, so websites can still be written in their usual HTML format; it's merely a supplemental set of rules that a computer can call on (so instead of adding a &lt;p&gt; for a new paragraph, one might say &lt;p class="intro"&gt;, with a programmer able to define that "intro" class with a very specific color, size, location on the page where it's supposed to appear, etc). This in turn made adoption of CSS much quicker and more widespread, in that companies weren't forced to rewrite their entire websites from scratch, and it's now the combination of HTML and CSS that largely determines the look and feel of nearly 100 percent of all websites in existence, supplemented with more powerful interactive elements using such additional languages as JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, Python, AJAX, etc.</p>

<p><b>The CSS Box Model and Margins, Borders and Padding</b></p>

<img class="floatleft" src="boxmodel.gif" alt="The CSS Box Model" />

<p>The fundamental thing to understand about CSS layout is that every element that appears on a page is placed into an invisible box, and that there are separate parts of this box that a designer can manipulate one by one, without affecting any other parts of the box. First is the box itself, which you define through the <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> tags; and that box has a border too, which you can make as thin or as thick as you want, or whatever color you want, using the <i>border</i> tag. But between the border of that box and the content inside of it (text, image, video, etc) is a space too, called "padding;" and you can make that as small or as large as you want too, keeping in mind that the box itself stays the same size no matter what the padding is. (So if you defined your box as being 300 pixels wide, and it's holding an image that's also 300 pixels wide, but your padding is 100 pixels on all four sides, that's going to hide part of your image because there's literally not room for it all). And then finally that box has a margin all the way around it, or the space between it and the box right next to it; and this too can be defined as large or as small as a person wants, in this case with the box itself staying the same size, but the distance between it and the other boxes on the page getting larger. Truly powerful layout can be accomplished by having so many elements that can be changed so profoundly; but this also quickly leads to a lot of confusion if you can't keep the various parts of the box separate and understood.</p>

<p><b>Classes versus IDs</b></p>

<p>In CSS you can directly define how an HTML tag itself is going to look, when that HTML page is used on that page; or you can make a special designation that's only applied part of the time, and which will only appear when that designation's nickname is referenced in the HTML tag. The two ways of doing this is through either a CLASS definition or an ID definition, literally appended to an HTML tag within its defining brackets (so &lt;img class="giant"&gt;, &lt;h1 id="title"&gt;, etc); literally the only difference between a class and an ID is that an ID can only be used one time on any given page, while a class designation can be used over and over.</p>

<p><b>Positioning: Relative, Absolute and Fixed</b></p>

<p>One of the biggest complaints among graphic designers when they first started getting involved with the Web in the '90s was that web browsers and HTML worked essentially like typewriters; the only way to display things was literally one line at a time, each of them automatically appearing directly below the thing before it, with no way to designate a special area of the page for a particular piece of that information, only the ability to say, "Here's what should appear at the top of the page, and here's what should appear below that, and here's what should appear below <i>that</i>." This has been addressed in CSS with the <i>position</i> tag, which is HUGELY powerful but therefore HUGELY confusing, a tag that lets you put any piece of information on a web page anywhere on that computer screen you want. It's a much more complicated system than I have time to go over today, but it essentially boils down to three choices a designer can make: either that position is <i>relative</i>, so that the numbers you're defining are numbers applied in relative position to the box before it (so if you say that the top margin should be 10 pixels, that's 10 pixels underneath the box that appears above it); or it's <i>absolute</i>, meaning that the numbers you're defining should be applied directly to the web browser itself (so in that case, if you say that the top margin should be 10 pixels, that's 10 pixels beneath the very tip-top of your web browser's screen, despite any other boxes that might also be there on that page). And <i>fixed</i> positioning is simply a different type of absolute positioning; it works the same, just that those elements don't actually move when you scroll from the top of your page to the bottom of your page.</p>

<p>The reason this gets so confusing is that the absolute positioning doesn't work exactly this easy; it's not actually the browser screen itself it's often referencing, but the "container" in which that element appears. And a "container" is simply an area of the browser window that the designer has specifically designated and defined; so if you think of a typical simple blog, for example, that page might include a "navigation" section where all the links to the blog's sections are found, a "header" section where you might find the date and title of that blog entry, an "article" section where the entry is, a "footer" where the copyright information and permalink can be found, etc. Technically an absolute position is referencing whatever section it's found in; so if you tell an image within the "article" container to be flush left, it's going to be flush-left <i>only to the left edge of the area of the page where the blog entry is found</i>. But if an element <i>isn't</i> within a certain section or container, then its absolute position <i>is</i> determined directly in reference to the web browser itself. Confused yet? Many people are, which is why positioning is easily the number-one problem among beginning students of HTML and CSS.</p>

<p><b>Display: Inline versus Inline Block</b></p>

<p>And finally, getting back to our typewriter metaphor from before, the original inventors of the Web tended to think of text primarily in terms of academic papers, where you type a line then hit your "carriage return" to go to the next line, then type another line and hit your carriage return again, etc. So to save themselves time, they defined some of their HTML tags to include an automatic carriage return to the next line, which is known as being displayed in a "block" style, tags like &lt;p&gt; for paragraph or &lt;h&gt; for header (or technically h1 through h6, because academes sure love their subtitles). But other HTML tags, like &lt;i&gt; for italics or &lt;b&gt; for bold, do <i>not</i> include automatic carriage returns to the next line, because you might be italicizing just one word in the middle of a paragraph but still want to finish that paragraph; and this is known as displaying in an "inline" style.</p>

<p>Only one problem among designers, though, which is sometimes they don't want an automatic carriage return with block elements; for one very common example, if you're building a horizontal row of buttons for a navigation menu using a list (invoking the &lt;ol&gt; [ordered list] or &lt;ul&gt; [unordered list] tag), those are both block elements, meaning the web browser will put those on new lines whether you want it to or not. So the inventors of CSS devised a new tag called <i>display</i> that lets you manually define this yourself, whether you want it to display as a traditional "block" or as a traditional "inline." But only one problem with this too, which is that sometimes you want the traditional perks that come with a "block" designation (for example, the ability to make that block a very specific size, which you can't do through "inline" display), but you still want those blocks to all appear on the same horizontal line like an inline display would do; so in that case you literally define the element as a display of "inline block," giving you the best of both worlds. <i>No, this stuff is not still without its problems and wonky details</i>, which is always the result of a big complicated thing being invented in little pieces over 25 years by a large group of unassociated people spread across the planet, which is how you end up with things like having to define an element as displaying as an "inline block" when in fact you shouldn't really have the inline OR block limitations to begin with; but for having been invented and updated in such a sloppy, chaotic way, HTML and CSS is still ultimately a surprisingly sophisticated yet easy-to-use system, which is why budding developers often start with this stuff before they move on to such heavier languages as Python, Java, C++ and all the rest.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's it for now, and I hope you'll have a chance to come back next week, when I'll be going over the first basics of the powerful computer language Ruby, the thing that will be taking up the vast majority of our time and attention over the 18 weeks in general that we're students at DevBootcamp.</p>
