  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 6</h1>
  <h2>Stereotype Threat and Imposter Syndrome</h2>
  <h3>March 14th, 2015</h3>
</header>

<article>
<p>I have to admit, my culture blog post today will be shorter than it usually is; and that's because we've been asked to write about the related topics of "stereotype threat" and "imposter syndrome" as it relates to the tech industry, and I simply don't have a lot to say about it as it relates personally to my life. These are basically phenomenon that were discovered in the work force during the 1990s, that negatively affect the concept of diversity within a work environment; in one, stereotypes about various races or genders being "worse" than others is maintained through subtle actions by all in an office subconsciously, without even realizing that they're doing it, while the other is when a "minority" in a work environment self-sabotages their jobs by feeling subconsciously like "they're not supposed to be there."</p>

<p>I want to be as clear as I can -- I believe in these phenomenon, I've seen them actually in practice (especially in the world of novel publishing which I do as my day job, where the specter of dowdy old straight white males hangs over the entire industry like the ghosts of a thousand elderly creative writing professors), and I'm committed to helping to overcome these kinds of problems in the workforces where I exist, both as an employee (in coding) and much more concretely when I'm a boss (like at my small press). But as a middle-aged straight white male with a college education who came from a middle-class, Protestant, suburban Midwestern upbringing, I'm as close to the "majority" as defined in these situations as you can possibly get, and I'd be insultingly lying if I said that I've ever been a situation where either stereotype threat or imposter syndrome even remotely applied to me. I can't speak from personal experience, so I'm simply not going to have much to say about this subject, other than I care about it as much as anyone else and that I have always tried to take concrete steps in my work life to combat it.</p>

<p>This is a big issue to be thinking about these days, what with the confluence of easy anonymous trolling and the "men's rights movement" causing so many ugly problems in the tech world (and especially in the world of gaming), and I hope all of you will have a chance soon to spend some time thinking about what you can be doing as an individual to help combat these insideous and sometimes difficult to solve situations.</p>
