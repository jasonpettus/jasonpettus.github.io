  <h1>DevBootcamp Furlough Blog Week 1</h1>
  <h2>Regarding injuries, deferrals, and "creating your own social network."</h2>
  <h3>April 16th, 2015</h3>

<article>
<p>Okay, so a bit of backstory before anything else...</p>

<p>As I've mentioned here before, DevBootcamp teaches not only pure programming skills as part of your education with them, but what they also call "emotional intelligence," which in a nutshell are lessons on how to get along with other people better, how to get along with yourself better, how to handle adversity and negative emotions better, and all the other things that get in the way of being a happy and productive worker within a corporate office atmosphere, especially among computer programmers who are notoriously bad at these kinds of issues. And as part of our "EQ" training, we're required attend yoga sessions twice a week while we're students, which is something I've never done before in my life.</p>

<p>So little did I know that I should've informed my yoga instructor that I have a bad physical injury as part of my past -- specifically, I got hit by a car in 2009 while I was on my bicycle, and ended up having posterior hip reconstruction surgery, which among other things required a month-long stay in the hospital and an entire year of daily physical therapy afterwards. And the reason I should've mentioned this is that there are lots of standard yoga poses that I can't actually do anymore -- anything involving repetitive rotating of my hip, for example, or bending my hip and my torso at more than a 90-degree angle, just to name two of many several things -- and so when I did exactly this during our first yoga session last week, turns out I did some pretty serious damage to myself, and now I'm in too much pain to really be able to focus in on all this detailed, brain-intensive coding to begin with, which I'm told I can expect to be the case for the next two weeks or so.</p>

<p>Thankfully, though, DevBootcamp has an option built into their program for situations like these; they let students actually repeat up to two of the different "phases" of the program with no penalties and no extra tuition, specifically for those who need to repeat one of those phases for whatever reason. (Just to explain it in detail, the main DBC program is nine weeks long and takes place down at their classroom center downtown, split into three phases of three weeks apiece; then in the last year they've added another nine weeks of a "Phase 0" that people do from home part-time, as a way of preparing themselves on as many of the fundamentals as possible before actually showing up at the center.) So this is exactly what I did, was exercise one of my deferral options after my re-injury; and while this would normally be a three-week furlough until I was ready to catch up with the next class after ours, it turns out that in my case, the next class after ours was cancelled for lack of students, so my particular furlough is going to last six weeks instead.</p>

<p>As a result, I'm in this kind of netherworld when it comes to the official program -- I won't be officially joining the next cohort for their Phase 0 stuff, since I've already actually completed and passed all the Phase 0 stuff, but they don't exactly want me to work ahead on the Phase 1 exercises either, since part of the point is to do these challenges in the immediacy of the moment as a standard student, to work out the issues with your coding partner that day and be able to call on the instructors who are roaming the classroom's aisles. So I'm kind of making a hybrid curriculum for myself that sort of combines both -- I'm not only going back and re-reading all the textbooks I only half-read last time, and redoing all the Phase 0 challenges by myself before looking at my former answers for help, I'm also doing general reading on the bigger issues coming up in Phase 1 (for example, subjects like recursion and regular expressions for week 1 of Phase 1), and doing sample exercises I find online, without necessarily doing the exact challenges that DBC themselves will be assigning me once it's time for me to start doing Phase 1 again, beginning at the end of May. And I have to say, I don't mind this at all; as I learned when first coming down to the classroom center last week, at the age of 46 I'm not only the oldest student in this building but also older than all the instructors too, and the simple fact is that all this stuff is taking a lot longer to sink in with me than it is all my fellow students. I just sort of barely got the hang of what was going on when I first went through Phase 0 this winter and spring, so I'm certainly not going to complain about having a chance to go through the entirety of it again, and really be able to master all these issues before hitting Phase 1 again in another five weeks from now.</p>

<p>So as long as I have the time and opportunity, I'm also going to be doing a special "furlough blog" here over those five weeks too, going back over some of these issues in more depth, as well as tackling the basics of some of the things I didn't get to write about the first time, like SQL and databases, jQuery and Underscore.js, and more. And meanwhile, DBC has very graciously invited me to continue coming down to the classroom center during my furlough, and work on my Phase 0 redux from the "alumni section" of the building (a series of tables along the side of the classroom center, where recent graduates can come hang out during the day while they continue looking for a job); and I'm also planning on attending DevBootcamp's weekly Thursday-evening lecture series by outside experts, called DBCx, and occasionally sharing notes and thoughts here about that.</p>

<p>And in fact, this is what I wanted to talk about for the rest of today's entry, last week's talk by a guy named <a href="https://twitter.com/karllhughes">Karl Hughes</a>, who's the head engineer at Chicago startup <a href="http://www.packbackbooks.com/">Packback</a>, a company that aims to rent ebook versions of textbooks to college students for a rate far less than what they would pay to outright own them. Interestingly, though, Karl's talk last week wasn't about engineering topics, but rather about networking, and how to improve the process of a new developer meeting lots of new people for the first time in the tech world, keeping track of those people they're meeting, sorting them into the types of people they may or may not want to keep in better contact with, and then maintaining that better contact. The fact of the matter is, even though there are way more programming jobs in the US in 2015 than there are qualified programmers, the process is still the age-old one that comes with any job in any industry; your success often depends on knowing the right person, hearing about the right opportunity at exactly the right time, having friends and colleagues who will recommend you for those opportunities, and then doing a good job at that interview you might eventually have for that opportunity. And the more "networking" within the tech industry you're able to do, the easier all those steps are going to go, which is why it's so important to master these kinds of skills in order to get the absolute best jobs that are available at any given time.</p>

<p>I've been thinking a lot about this subject, because the fact is that I'm pretty much starting in this industry from scratch, after being in the arts for the last 25 years but with none of those hundreds of artist contacts I've developed able to do the first thing about getting me a Ruby job at a startup. But the problem, I've discovered over the years, is that the traditional methods that have been set up for aiding this networking are largely methods that no longer work well, or that never worked well in the first place, which is then combined with my hearing problems to make for a real challenge when it comes to making professional connections. Just for one example, one of the most popular ways of building connections is the so-called "networking event," where basically a couple of hundred strangers are thrown into a cavernous bar together at the same time, and the idea is to walk around having little conversations with people and trying to make new acquaintances that way; but as anyone who has attended these types of events knows, this is about the most imperfect way possible to make such acquaintances, in that the spaces are always too loud and chaotic, no one wants to have an actual substantial conversation, groups of friends and colleagues clique up within the space like a high-school dance, and the addition of liquor does nothing but exacerbate all of these problems. And meanwhile, the once inspring promise of online social networks to solve these problems has largely devolved not just into zero help but often <i>worse</i> than zero; LinkedIn is a muddled mess full of people you don't actually know, Twitter is like a firehose of unfiltered information about every subject under the sun, and Facebook is filled with all those annoying high-school acquaintances you couldn't stand in the first place, choking up your feed with baby pictures and reposts of easy platitudes and angry political rants that make you want to choke the life out of them.</p>

<p>Karl, though, suggested a very simple alternative to these situations in his talk, something that really intrigued me -- that you simply create your own private social network yourself, by maintaining a spreadsheet on your own computer's hard drive with the names of all the people you meet in your industry who you find "intriguing" or that you feel compelled to keep up with on a regular basis. Then you simply set a reminder in your calendar every three months to pull up this spreadsheet; and four times a year you simply drop a line to everyone on this list, whether that's through email or the phone, to either catch up through a letter or (better yet) meet up for a coffee and some one-on-one conversation. When that happens, then, Karl actually has a...well, it wouldn't be fair to call it a "script," but certainly he has an idea in his head of a "course of conversation" that will usually last around 45 minutes with most people, where you start by getting caught up with how their work situation is going and what kinds of projects they're working on, and generally moves into more intimate subjects like their aims and goals for the next few months, and perhaps a bit about their families or their aspirations and fears about life if you're truly personal friends with them.</p>

<p>Something simple like this, he says, can go a long way towards maintaining a truly powerful group of networking contacts, without having to deal with any of the overly hyped buzzwords of your industry and the trendy gimmicks that come with most networking; and what I like the most about this idea is that you concentrate on the people you truly find interesting, and base all your networking around legitimately fascinating conversations about legitimately fascinating things. This is always a problem with networking, as nearly anyone who's done it can tell you; part of that process almost always involves meeting people you can't really stand, and as a result you're always playing this balancing game between how much help that person might be able to professionally provide you versus how little time you have to actually spend with them to gain that help. Karl suggests avoiding that game altogether, and simply spending all your efforts just on making the relationships with truly interesting people as sincerely rewarding as you can, and reaping the benefits simply as a side-effect of the main purpose of just getting to spend some time with people you like. And he seems to be doing just fine professionally, so I think I'm going to be heeding his advice in the months ahead, and see how such an effort to build my own private social network full of legitimately interesting people might pan out.</p>

<p>Anyway, that's it for this week, but make sure to check back next Tuesday, when I'll be going over the subjects of recursion and regular expressions, two advanced topics in the world of programming that can be hard sometimes to wrap your mind around, but that are very important when it comes to things like databases and finding specific information within them.</p>
