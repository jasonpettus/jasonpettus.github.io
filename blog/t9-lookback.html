  <h1>DevBootcamp Tech Blog Week 9</h1>
  <h2>A look back at Phase 0, and a look ahead to Phase 1.</h2>

<article>
<p>Well, what do you know -- I have actually made it successfully to the end of the first half of the DevBootcamp "computer programming crash course" program, and am finalizing my plans as we speak to start attending the second nine weeks of DBC down at their classroom center in downtown Chicago (kittycorner from the Merchandise Mart, for those who are curious, on its northwest side, and how metaphorically interesting that I'll be taking these classes literally in the shadow of the world's former symbolic center for the Industrial-Age economy). For this week's tech blog entry, then, DBC has asked us merely to go back over this entire website in general, get some feedback from trusted friends, and do a "refactoring" of it to now reflect the things we've been learning in the last nine weeks; and they've also asked us to look back over the last nine weeks in general, and to share some of our opinions and memories of it.</p>

<p>See, for those who don't know, only up to about a year ago, DevBootcamp <i>only</i> consisted of the nine weeks down at the classroom center; but they've recently decided to add an entire extra nine weeks where students work from home only part-time, to try to get as much of the pure theory and the fundamentals learned beforehand, so they can hit the classroom center running and be able to actually code real programs for eight+ hours a day. And so as a result, it's a different kind of learning than we are used to from public educational institutions, not only a lot faster but just concentrating on the "boring" stuff like memorizing commands, without the fun part of seeing something working or the reassuring part where you pause, look back over what you've been learning, and prove to yourself that it's sinking in. And that comes with a lot of frustrations, I have to admit -- like feelings of being overwhelmed and defeated on a regular basis, a sense that things are simply moving too fast, being cranky to your friends and loved ones, etc. The promise of a programming bootcamp is that they'll teach you just what you need to know to get a decent job, much faster and much cheaper than getting a two-year degree in a community college; but to do that, they have to cram things in as fast and as much as possible, and this is a burden you're voluntarily choosing to take on when you choose to go through a bootcamp yourself.</p>

<p>Ultimately what I've learned in middle-age is that no matter how a situation comes about, the bottom line is that if something is affecting you in a way you don't like, it's up to you to simply find a personal solution for it, usually by examining the situation closely and understanding what about it in particular is upsetting you; and so that's how I ended up doing flashcards of built-in Ruby methods on top of my usual DBC classwork every week, because I realized what was frustrating me most was not the understanding of all the whys, but merely the challenge as a middle-ager to memorize how to actually type out one of these command lines, and where all the little "bleeps and bloops" go (the little catchphrase I've invented in my mind to refer to all the crazy little semicolons and curly brackets and everything else you have to exactly memorize in order to get a line of computer code to work, and how these orders change just the slightest bit in every single different computer language that exists). And then we got to weeks 8 and 9, where we did finally have a chance to simply pause and look back over what we've done in the last two months; and that's when I realized, only just very recently, that this stuff really is sinking in with me, and that I'm able to go back through and look at these older challenges again with a lot more confidence and understanding. But I have to say, in the two months before that, I was more stressed than at any other point I had had in my adult life; and it's important that people thinking of going through a bootcamp program know that, so they can prepare for it and not have it be a big unpleasant surprise like it was with me. <i>Everyone</i> in the bootcamp is feeling like this at the same time, it's important to know, precisely because these bootcamps legitimately are trying to squeeze in about the maximum amount of new information a human being can even take; and it doesn't necessarily mean that you're failing to take it all in, just that it's all coming at you at this unbelievable pace, and with no changes to pause and reflect on it all.</p>

<p>For me in particular, I've found that the stuff that has resonated the most with me so far is the really abstract stuff, the "agile programming" issues about how best to design a big complex program in the first place; and I suppose this is a reflection of me having been in the arts for 25 years before this, and my brain already trained to think in these abstract, big-picture ways. And it turns out that this even has a special name and job type in the tech industry, known as "software architecture," which are some of the highest paying jobs in the entire programming world; so even here at the very beginning of my career, I already know that this is a specialty I should absolutely look more into after I graduate from DBC, a possible direction for my career to go in the coming years as I gain more and more experience. That's something to always be thinking about as you're going through a programming bootcamp, that your 18 weeks with them just literally gets you to "step zero" as far as being minimally qualified for a bottom-rung job at some corporate office, doing largely just routine maintenance and debugging; if you want to eventually get promoted into more interesting and better-paying jobs, then it's up to you to start getting your "self-taught Masters" in whatever area of the industry you most want to specialize, by doing online courses and reading books, taking on a new real-world project and learn by doing, talking up the subject with your programmer friends, etc. I myself have had three specialties I've been thinking about up to now -- videogame development, mobile development for iOS and Android, and so-called "Big Data" -- but software architecture is rapidly becoming a fourth interest now too, and will be something I'll be thinking about more and more as I go through Phases 1, 2 and 3 at the classroom center.</p>

<p>I must admit, I'm really looking forward to going down to the actual DBC center every day during these next two and a half months; it's been frustrating as a person who's hard of hearing to deal with all the imperfect tech of video chatting for Phase 0, and lonely to do it all by myself in front of my cold Mac screen here at home. Thankfully, I was actually able to meet up physically in the real world with something like five or six of my fellow students during Phase 0, to do our required weekly pairing sessions in person instead of online; and that's really nice, because I'll have had these much more laid-back and friendly one-and-one experiences with a third of my classmates before we all hit the big group environment next week. And I'm also looking forward to getting to just code and code, over and over, for hours and hours on end, which has been the big thing missing from our first nine weeks; we were trying to cover so much ground in so little time, we simply moved from one big concept to the next on a daily basis, with no chance to really stop and better memorize commands, tinker around with them, see what makes them work and what their limits are, etc. And yes, even with my relatively short tolerance for "new-agey" stuff, I'm even looking forward to the yoga sessions we are required as students to participate in down at the DBC classroom center, and am looking forward to being part of a legitimate community for the first time in years, after owning my own one-person home-based business for the last decade of my life. It's been a tough Phase 0, one of the bigger challenges of my entire adult life; but I'm feeling confident and cautiously excited about things here at the end of it, and enthusiastic about entering the next big phase of it all.</p>

<p>Technically our required commitment to this student blog is now over, DBC has told us in this week's homework packet, but they've encouraged us to keep maintaining and updating it anyway; and I've decided to go ahead and do just that, because it's not just good for me but I feel provides a good overlook and some advice for people who are thinking of going through a programming bootcamp themselves, and who are maybe finding this in the future after Googling for online advice about the subject. But that said, the first thing I'll be doing is consolidating the separate "technical" and "culture" blogs we kept during Phase 0, and combining them into one longer entry each week that covers both the technical issues we learned that week and how I was feeling as I was going through them. The first entry of that will be coming next weekend, after spending my first week down at the actual DBC classroom center every day, so I hope you'll have a chance to come by again for that.</p>
