  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 7</h1>
  <h2>More on Stereotype Threat</h2>
  <h3>March 17, 2015</h3>
</header>

<article>
<p>This week's blog entry is going to be another short one for me; and that's because we've been asked to once again write on the subject of "stereotype threat" (or in other words, the phenomenon by which people in minority groups unconsciously self-sabotage their performance, because they're in a situation where traditionally minorities have been expected to perform poorly). And again, like last week, let me be as clear as I possibly can be about this subject -- <b>I believe that stereotype threat exists, I've seen stereotype threat actually in action in front of my eyes, and I am committed to trying not to support stereotype threat in the environments in which I am an employee and/or am in a leadership position</b>. But that said, the very definition of "minority" in this situation is in direct relation to what we might call a "majority" -- so in other words, a non-gay, non-woman, non-person-of-color, non-poor, non-un-Christian, non-ghetto, non-rural human being. And that, ladies and gentlemen, is the exact definition of Jason Pettus, which means I'm the exact person by which others derive the very definition of "minority" and "stereotype threat" to begin with. And that means, by its very definition, I'm incapable of experiencing stereotype threat myself, which is why my write-ups on this subjects are always by necessity short and not very interesting.</p>

<p>But that said, DevBootcamp has this week asked us to go through a series of very specific exercises as part of our blog entry, so here we go...</p>

<p>"Q1: When you think of the times in your life where you've been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?" (full list redacted from this blog entry)</p>

<p>A: Achievement, ambition, autonomy, competence, confidence, control, creativity, credibility, decisiveness, efficiency, fame, freedom, independence, influence, insight, intellectual status, introspection, leadership, power and authority, privacy, self-knowledge, self-reliance, sophistication.</p>

<p>"Q2: On a scale from 1 to 5, I try to live up to these values this amount."</p>

<p>A: Achievement: 5, ambition: 4, autonomy: 5, competence: 5, confidence: 3, control: 5, creativity: 4, credibility: 2, decisiveness: 3, efficiency: 5, fame: 1, freedom: 5, independence: 5, influence: 4, insight: 5, intellectual status: 5, introspection: 5, leadership: 5, power and authority: 4, privacy: 4, self-knowledge: 5, self-reliance: 3, sophistication: 2.</p>

<p>"Q3: Pick one value and write a couple of sentences about why the value you chose is important to you."</p>

<p>A: <b>Independence.</b> I've always been someone who's been dismayed and disgusted by the "herd mentality," ever since I was a little kid; and the other I get, the more pronounced this becomes, to the point where I can no longer even travel during rush hour without being profoundly disappointed in myself, or eat lunch at a restaurant between 12:00 and 1:00. My ability to live my life completely free of the restraints that the rest of society imposes upon itself is one of the most important considerations in my life, and I will gladly sacrifice other things (like money, love and health) in order to maintain this fierce dedication to living my life in whatever way I personally see fit, no matter what anyone else thinks of it.</p>

<p>"Q4: What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Did it relate to any of the values you found important?"</p>

<p>A: A few weeks ago, I was asked by a student literary magazine to give advice to their staff on increasing their public profile in the city, and especially how to use social media to best accomplish this. It definitely related to many of the values on the above list.</p>

<p>"Q5: How do you feel when you think about your values? Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?"</p>

<p>A: Not applicable to me; by its very definition, I never experience stereotype threat.</p>

<p>More next week, so I hope to see you then!</p>
