  <h1>DevBootcamp Culture Blog Week 4</h1>
  <h2>Shedding the "Tech Mindset" in a Non-Tech World</h2>
  <h3>March 1, 2015</h3>
</header>

<article>
<p>Today, to finish up week 4 of DevBootcamp, the DBC staff is having us do something a bit different with our culture blog this time than usual; instead of sharing our personal feelings about the emotions we've been going through this week, we've been told to think of a larger issue facing the tech industry, to research it, then to share a few thoughts about it here today. And this combined with my growing conversation about the videogame industry with Christian, one of my fellow students who is already an existing "indie game" small-time developer (mostly done just for fun so far in his life, at these social "hackerthon" and "hacker weekend" type events), has had me thinking this week about the bitter experiences I had with a videogame company almost ten years ago now, and how that was a perfect example of a topic that is hugely affecting the tech industry -- namely, of how to shed the "tech attitude" or the "tech mindset" or whatever you want to call it, of the typical fan in this industry (or specifically the "gamer mindset" as I'll be calling it for the rest of today, since that's the specific thing I myself am talking about), so to not be constantly alienating the people who you're trying to be your loyal and devoted customers.</p>

<p>See, in 2006, I got deeply and overwhelming obsessed with the "virtual-world platform" <a href="http://www.secondlife.com">Second Life</a>, my first videogame I had played with regularity since I was a teen in the early '80s; although "game" is not the right thing to call Second Life, because there's not a predescribed "thing" to "do" there; it's instead an attempt to take a videogame-like interface but to let people do whatever they want, whether that's sitting around socializing, communicating beteween companies and customers, meeting up with random sexual partners, running a nonprofit or educational institution, using lessons on Photoshop and 3D design as a way to sell everything from virtual clothing to furniture to vehicles to houses, and yes, sometimes even gaming (although not very much -- among teens who are heavily into the subject, Second Life is derided as a gaming platform, best put by the incidental insult "Oh yeah, that's that place <i>my mom goes to</i>").</p>

<p>I found the place utterly fascinating when I first explored it a decade ago, right at the very beginning of the whole blow-up into the mainstream culture that Second Life underwent that year; and I did a blog at the time about all the interesting artistic and sexual things that people were doing in Second Life, called <a href="http://www.jasonpettus.com/inthegrid">In The Grid</a> (caution, sometimes cartoon-NSFW), and it accidentally ballooned into the most popular written project I had ever done in my life as an artist, eventually getting ranked by Google as the seventh most popular blog about Second Life on the planet. But only one problem -- that after scraping together every penny I had at the beginning of 2006 to buy a new bigger computer that would just barely run Second Life okay, by a year and a half later the growing technical requirements of newer versions had already grown Second Life too powerful for that computer, meaning I would need to go out and buy yet another computer just to get it to start working right again, and I didn't have even a spare dollar at that point for another computer.</p>

<p>I bugged some of the employees of Linden Labs, owners of Second Life, about this issue for awhile in the company's official online forums, and wanted to know what they were in the process of doing about subjects like theses, of the growing tech requirements for the "great" version of Second Life, and whether they were ever going to build something for just an "okay" version to run well on computers like mine; but eventually, although no said these exact words, it became clear that the developers really had no interest in even having this conversation to begin with, and usually ended all conversations on the matter with some form or another of, "You just need to go out and buy another computer, just like all gamers are expected to do if they want to keep up with the newest versions of games." And when I would complain about the expensiveness of an answer like this to a poverty-level artist like me, it would always devolve into some form or another of, "If you can't afford to buy a new computer every year and a half, or at least do some complicated and expensive upgrade of your hardware every year and a half, then we really don't want you as a customer in the first place, and you can go back to your Facebook or whatever lame thing you middle-aged non-gamer people do." And so that's what I did, is I quit Second Life altogether, with a lot of disgust and a lot of anger over encountering this moral brick wall like this whenever I'd try to talk about real frustrations with the software to the company's owners; and then soon after I did this, the two million non-gamers who had gotten Second Life on the cover of <i>Newsweek</i> to begin with all quit too, after they realized the same thing I did, that all the breathless articles in the world amount to nothing if you can't get your middle-of-the-road Best Buy British laptop special to actually run the software well. And thus, a mere year after the hype about Second Life even begun, did the hype completely implode on itself; and now it's merely a shell of the bustling, fascinating world it once was, no longer a much-discussed new possibility for a completely overhauled interface for the Web in general, but now something to semi-embarrassingly date its decade just as thoroughly as a pet rock defines the '70s.</p>

<p>Clearly this was a case where the "gamer mindset" got in the way of the people accidentally having the mainstream success that no one was expecting; and instead of acknowledging this new situation, understanding that their sudden new giant user base was a million computer casuals who had no idea what "Alienware" even meant, and trying to tailor their product more to them, this office full of developers who had all come from videogame backgrounds decided to barrel through with blinders on and continue maintaining the gamer mindset through it all, assuming that their customer base was still Simpsons "Comic Book Guys" who spent all their disposable income and time on new graphic chips instead of romantic partners or children, and who above all else craved big new jumps in visual and other technical sophistication as fast as possible, instead of better navigation or better maps or better group notifications or better social networking or better banking, or any of another dozen things about the "low-memory" part of Second Life people constantly complained about but that Linden Labs never bothered doing even a single thing to improve. If these gamer enthusiasts had been able to get out of their own gamer heads, they'd have the next Twitter on their hands by now, a major new communications platform that would be generating a billion dollars in revenue a year for the employees of Linden; but instead they were dead-set to have their "gamer destination" come hell or high water, missed a huge golden egg that was accidentally plopped right in their laps, and now are back to being what they were when they first started, a tiny "World of Warcraft wannabe" trying to compete within a traditional gaming industry, with just a fraction of WOW's user base, annual revenue, or cultural cache.</p>

<p>Where are you as a developer accidentally slapping on those blinders and going forward with the "tech mindset?" Do you regularly look at your creations from the standpoint and mindset of, say, your non-tech suburban mom? What things do you and your friends overworry about as tech enthusiasts, that casuals could care less about? What things do they want that you consider unimportant? And how well does your product still work on their sad freaking 2003 colored iMac in the back den that now crashes every 20th boot-up and that you have begged them to replace for years now? <i>Well? How well does it work on <b>that</b>?</i> Remember that every time you work on a piece of software for the general public, it's going to primarily have users who aren't the tech obsessives that you and all your friends are, and that these people might present you with an accidental golden opportunity as long as you're able to actually see and acknowledge it, instead of forcing them to be something they don't want to be, causing them all to give you the finger and go home.</p>

<p>More next Sunday, so I hope you'll have a chance to come by again then!</p>
